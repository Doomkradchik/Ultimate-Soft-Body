## Ultimate Soft Body

Welcome to Ultimate Soft Body, an advanced GPU-accelerated soft body simulation designed for gaming environments. This project enables the realistic and dynamic simulation of over 20,000 soft particles, adding a new level of realism and immersion to your games.

### Features:

- **GPU Calculations:** Leverage the power of GPU computations to efficiently simulate and render soft bodies in real-time, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
  
- **High Particle Count:** Simulate an impressive number of soft particles, exceeding 20,000, to create intricate and detailed soft body effects in your game.

- **Realistic Deformation:** Achieve lifelike soft body deformation and interaction, allowing for natural movement and response to external forces within the gaming environment.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Fine-tune the simulation to meet your specific requirements with customizable parameters for stiffness, damping, and other key properties.

- **Easy Integration:** Integrate the Ultimate Soft Body library seamlessly into your game project, thanks to clear and straightforward API documentation.

### Getting Started:

To get started with Ultimate Soft Body, refer to the [documentation](#link-to-documentation) for installation instructions, usage guidelines, and example code snippets.

### Example:

```python
import ultimate_soft_body

# Initialize soft body simulation
soft_body_sim = ultimate_soft_body.SoftBodySim()

# Set simulation parameters
soft_body_sim.set_parameters(stiffness=0.8, damping=0.5, ...)

# Simulate and render soft body
soft_body_sim.update()
soft_body_sim.render()
```
